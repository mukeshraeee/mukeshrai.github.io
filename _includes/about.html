                I hold a Master in Environmental Science and M.S by research in Glaciology. Currently, working as PhD fellow at UCAS. My specialization lies in atmospheric science. Part of my PhD works includes the aerosol simulation using WRF-Chem model and multi-sensors satellite. I have experience with the high performance computing (HPC) and Linux system. I have a keen interest in aerosol transport mechanism, synergy on aerosol-boundary layer interaction, and radaitive forcing.
